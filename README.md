# MoeStreamer

A tiny macOS app that sits in the menubar, to stream music from [LISTEN.moe](https://listen.moe). It also lets you play local playlists from iTunes (or Music.app â€” same thing).

## Features

1. Streaming from LISTEN.moe, including (un)favouriting when logged in
2. Playback from local iTunes (Music.app) library
3. Search for local music
4. *ALWAYS* overrides media keys (F7-F9, or touchbar buttons) when the app is open.

When logging in to LISTEN.moe, the account password is stored in the macOS Keychain.

## Screenshots

Here's how it looks like in the menubar:

## Building

### macOS 11 (Bug Sir) or higher

Here, you should use CocoaPods to install VLCKit:
 
```
pod install
```

Then, open `MoeStreamer.xcworkspace` instead of `xcproj` (because that's how CocoaPods works...). Once the VLCKit people release 3.3.18 with the fix for macOS 11 I'll get rid of cocoapods.


### macOS Catalina (10.15) or lower
You can install VLCKit via Carthage:

```
carthage update --platform macos
```

However, you need to open the project in Xcode, and add `VLCKit.framework`, under the *Frameworks, Libraries, and Embedded Content* list in the **Target Settings**. Choose "Embed and Sign".

Either way, after installing the dependencies, either run `xcodebuild` from the terminal, or open Xcode 
and build it from there.
