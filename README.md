# MoeStreamer

A tiny macOS app that sits in the menubar, to stream music from [LISTEN.moe](https://listen.moe). It also lets you play local playlists from iTunes (or Music.app â€” same thing).

## Features

1. Streaming from LISTEN.moe, including (un)favouriting when logged in
2. Playback from local iTunes (Music.app) library
3. Search for local music
4. *ALWAYS* overrides media keys (F7-F9, or touchbar buttons) when the app is open.

When logging in to LISTEN.moe, the account password is stored in the macOS Keychain.

## Screenshots

Here's how it looks like in the menubar:
